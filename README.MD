### Description
Open source is growing with leaps and bounds. Even corporations are adopting the open source products and reaping the numerous benefits. But there’s more than the products that need to be adopted – the Open Source Model itself is also highly valuable.

Learn how adopting the Open Source Model can improve your organization’s “time to market”, product quality, professional climate, and Agile adoption. We’ll focus on what constitutes an Open Source mindset, how to implement it, and some of the pitfalls and anti-patterns to avoid.
