### Usage Agreement & License

> This is where you publish the product's licensing and conditions for usage.

> **NOTE:** Make sure to publish your license (or direct link to the license / usage agreement) on your product website as well as on your README in your repo. This is a VERY important document that needs to be included in all distributions of the source code and product. A common why to make the product license visible at a glance is to use badges (a.k.a.: shields - see link below)
